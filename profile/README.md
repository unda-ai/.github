# Unda ML
## Robust Machine Learning Library in Rust with a focus on control and performance ðŸŒŠðŸ¦¾

We're Unda, a team of Rust developers interested in bringing Machine Learning to the world of Rust in a robust way. Using a [XLA](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/xla-rs) backend wrapped with an intuitive compute graph intermediate layer, the Unda crate promises the performance of current Python libraries with the portability and control of a systems level programming language.
